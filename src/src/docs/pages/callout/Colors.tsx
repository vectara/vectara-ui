                Carbon fibers or carbon fibres (alternatively CF, graphite fiber or graphite fibre) are fibers about 5
                to 10 micrometers (0.00020â€“0.00039 in) in diameter and composed mostly of carbon atoms.

                Carbon fibers have several advantages: high stiffness, high tensile strength, high strength to weight
                ratio, high chemical resistance, high-temperature tolerance, and low thermal expansion.[2] These
                properties have made carbon fiber very popular in aerospace, civil engineering, military, motorsports,
                and other competition sports.[3] However, they are relatively expensive compared to similar fibers, such
                as glass fiber, basalt fibers, or plastic fibers.
